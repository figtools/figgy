These are problems I intend to solve, once I figure out the best way to do it.

## Todo:
- Test release rollback
- Add version to anonymous tracking
- Implement validate command
- `figgy config get --role dev` fails with sandbox login.
- Double check. Deletes don't seem to be showing up in slack webhook

## Ideas:
- Remove need for users to have allow 'Python'


- Add support for "ExternalId" verification for cross-account role assumption from Bastion.
- Param finder
- Figgy Experimental
- Unused parameter recommender
- 1 time password share-er
