These are problems I intend to solve, once I figure out the best way to do it.

- Figgy Vault
- Version & Update prompts

__
- Refactor figgy to not require a mgmt session anywhere to support existing functionality
- Fix promote command
- Fix or remove migrate command


- Custom configuration of various SSO providers in a non-intrusive way (that doesn't require lots of brainpower for users)
    - Enable users to embed default configs into the figgy deployment artifact
    - What about auto-upgrade 
    
- What do I do with auto-upgrade feature?

- Add figgy to pypi? `pip install figgy`?
    - If someone does `pip install figgy` - how do they import their company's unique SSO configurations elegantly?


- Add support for "ExternalId" verification for cross-account role assumption from Bastion.

- Slack integration for shares / etc.

- Param finder

- Figgy Experimental

- Unused parameter recommender

- 1 time password share-er
