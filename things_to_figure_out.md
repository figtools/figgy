## Todo:
- Give configured lower environment(s) replication key access

- Add automated test with replicate from
- Support for multi-profile
- Make CLI used shared libs.
- Pre-commit hook
- Fix "requests" dependency on legacy botocore layer thing
- CW alarm email integration

## Ideas:
- `figgy --reset` or `figgy reset`

- Param finder
