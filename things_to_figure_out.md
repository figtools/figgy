These are problems I intend to solve, once I figure out the best way to do it.

- Move webhook url from under /figgy b/c all bastions users can see /figgy

- Get CircleCi builds working with full test suite execution.


__
   
- What do I do with auto-upgrade feature?

- Add figgy to pypi? `pip install figgy`?
    - If someone does `pip install figgy` - how do they import their company's unique SSO configurations elegantly?

- Add support for "ExternalId" verification for cross-account role assumption from Bastion.

- Param finder

- Figgy Experimental

- Unused parameter recommender

- 1 time password share-er
