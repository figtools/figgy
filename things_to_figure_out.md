These are problems I intend to solve, once I figure out the best way to do it.

## Todo:
- groups for people using --profile for everything?
- Figgy Lib PyDocs
- Do python demo top-to-bottom

- Test release rollback
- Add automated test with replicate from
- Support for multi-profile
- Make CLI used shared libs.
- Pre-commit hook
- Fix "requests" dependency on legacy botocore layer thing
- CW alarm email integration

## Ideas:
- `figgy --reset` or `figgy reset`

- Remove need for users to have allow 'Python'
- Personal passpack by using tags.

- Add support for "ExternalId" verification for cross-account role assumption from Bastion.
- Param finder
- Figgy Experimental
- Unused parameter recommender
- 1 time password share-er
- Encrypted event batching & backup to s3

# Docs to write

- Python Example Doc
- Repo Guide

# Maybe one day:
- Usage metric tracking on `--profile session overrides`
