These are problems I intend to solve, once I figure out the best way to do it.

- Version & Update prompts

- Figgy Vault
- Slack integration for shares / etc.

__

- Refactor figgy to not require a mgmt session anywhere to support existing functionality
- Fix promote command
- Fix or remove migrate command
    
- What do I do with auto-upgrade feature?

- Add figgy to pypi? `pip install figgy`?
    - If someone does `pip install figgy` - how do they import their company's unique SSO configurations elegantly?


Ã’- Add support for "ExternalId" verification for cross-account role assumption from Bastion.


- Param finder

- Figgy Experimental

- Unused parameter recommender

- 1 time password share-er
