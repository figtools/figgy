These are problems I intend to solve, once I figure out the best way to do it.

## Todo:
- Give configured lower environment(s) replication key access
- Update to figlib to prevent name colissions?
- Do python demo top-to-bottom

- Test release rollback
- Create sample application that shows CICD validation.
- Add automated test with replicate from
- Support for multi-profile
- Make CLI used shared libs.
- Pre-commit hook

## Ideas:
- `figgy --reset` or `figgy reset`

- Personal passpack by using tags.

- Add support for "ExternalId" verification for cross-account role assumption from Bastion.
- Param finder
- Figgy Experimental
- Unused parameter recommender
