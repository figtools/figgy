These are problems I intend to solve, once I figure out the best way to do it.

## Todo:
- Move webhook url from under /figgy b/c all bastions users can see /figgy
- Wipe figgy vault on reconfigure 
- Wipe defaults on reconfigure
- Bug with issue deletes on trees in browse
- Cache syncer assumes basic NS names.. remove that
- Remove test package for master build, but use it for other uses.


## Ideas:
- Add support for "ExternalId" verification for cross-account role assumption from Bastion.
- Param finder
- Figgy Experimental
- Unused parameter recommender
- 1 time password share-er
