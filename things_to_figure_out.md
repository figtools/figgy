These are problems I intend to solve, once I figure out the best way to do it.

## Todo:
- Test release rollback
- Double check ssl is good on api gateway endpoints later.

## Ideas:
- Add support for "ExternalId" verification for cross-account role assumption from Bastion.
- Param finder
- Figgy Experimental
- Unused parameter recommender
- 1 time password share-er
